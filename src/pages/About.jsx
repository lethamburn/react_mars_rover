        Sol (borrowed from the Latin word for sun) is a solar day on Mars; that
        is, a Mars-day. A sol is the apparent interval between two successive
        returns of the Sun to the same meridian (sundial time) as seen by an
        observer on Mars. It is one of several units for timekeeping on Mars. A
        sol is slightly longer than an Earth day. It is approximately 24 hours,
        39 minutes, 35 seconds long. A Martian year is approximately 668 sols,
        equivalent to approximately 687 Earth days or 1.88 Earth years.
